Hello, this is my ReadME for the Module 4 Lesson 2 assignment! 
For the 'city_infrastructure_management' file, there is a 'Vehicle' class with the attributes: 
- 'reg_num' for registration number
- 'type' for vehicle type (i.e. sedan, truck, hybrid, motorcycle) 
- 'owner' for name of owner

Within the class are also methods for updating the owner name of a registered vehicle and displaying all registered vehicle's information. 
This file showcases my understanding of classes and objects, along with class methods and instances. 

The second file named 'event_management_enhancement' contains a class 'Events' with attributes 'name' and 'date'. 
Within this class are methods to count participants added into a created event and to retrieve the total count of 
however many participants are added to said event. 
This file showcases my understanding of methods within classes and further object creation. Thank you!
